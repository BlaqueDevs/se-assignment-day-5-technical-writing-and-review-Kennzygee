## 1. How can understanding your audienceâ€™s expertise level (tech experts vs. regular folks) shape the way you present technical information?
The way you present a technical information is dependent on the audience's expertise level in the sense that their way of understanding your information will differ. Your presentation has to be tailored based on their level of expertise so the audience can flow with whatever information your passing.

Outline.
Create graphics and images
Correct spellings.
Use active voice
